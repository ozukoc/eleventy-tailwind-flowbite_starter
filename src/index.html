            <p>Running 11ty and tailwind with the same npm command can cause some issues, so I am running them separetly.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>No 11ty templates for now. I just addedd navbar/footer from flowbite components.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Also for now I included Flowbite with CDN. This can change in later commits.</p>
